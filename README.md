# RPC-Fast Website Clone

A front-end reactjs project heavily inspired by https://rpcfast.com/

The original site uses mostly tailwindCSS for the styling of the website but this clone uses react and vanilla CSS to render similar aesthetics. The focus was mostly on giving the site similar aesthetics to the inspiration site and not on similar functionality. I know that sounds like an excuse but I will try to incorporate many new features as I learn.

Please note that even though it is heavily inspired by the above page, I couldn't resist adding that "me" element to it. So the differences that you might encounter are likely becasue I found them to be a better fit.

Please feel free to clone and tweak the code to produce different unique results.
